# Generative Image Inpainting with Contextual Attention, Gated Convolution and SN-PatchGAN

This is a fork of https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting (the official code release of inpainting with contextual attention https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892) which attempts to implement the features described in their subsequent paper introducing Gated Convolutions (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03589.pdf) and some other experimental features such as multiresolution contextual attention.

It correspondingly depends on a fork of the neuralgym library (`pip install git+https://github.com/ShnitzelKiller/NeuralGymWithEXR.git@sngan`)
